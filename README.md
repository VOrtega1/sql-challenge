PROJECT TITLE: SQL Challenge

PostgreSQL 13 in order to move csv files to a Server. Created a database to hold those CSV and imported the csv to the tables in order to view files.
Visual Studio Code was used to save files as .sql 
Enity Relationship Diagram Tool (ERD) was downloaded to in order to visualize the inter-relationships between the database tables and their columns.

 Used ER diagram tool to make connections between tables using primary keys. Simplified the join of tables. Was able to sort through data, used group by, pulled specific criteria from 6 different tables.

Practice creating a new server, database, schemas and tables using existing csv files in PostgreSQL 13. 
Joined Tables in order to pull details from each employee, including employee numbers, last name, first names, salary, titles and department names for each employee.
